[hgrep][] is a grep tool to search files with a given pattern and print the matched code snippets with human-friendly syntax
highlighting. This tool brings search results like the code search on GitHub to your local machine. In short, it's something like
searching files with [ripgrep][] and showing results with [bat][].

This is similar to `-C` option of `grep` command. hgrep is useful to survey the matches with contexts around them. When some
matches are near enough, hgrep prints the lines within one code snippet. Unlike `grep -C`, hgrep adopts some heuristics around
blank lines to determine an efficient number of context lines.

Example:

```sh
# Use built-in subset of ripgrep (optional)
hgrep pattern ./dir

# Read results of grep command via stdin
grep -nH pattern -R ./dir | hgrep
rg -nH pattern ./dir | hgrep
```

hgrep provides two printers to print match results for your use case. Please see ['`bat` printer v.s. `syntect` printer'][bat-vs-syntect]
section for the comparison.

- `syntect` printer (default): Our own implementation of printer using [syntect][] library. Performance, output layout, and color
  themes are more optimized
- `bat` printer: Printer built on top of [bat][]'s pretty printer implementation, which is battle-tested and provides some unique
  features

Please see [the usage section](#usage) for more details.

## Installation

### Binary releases

Visit [the releases page][releases] and download the zip file for your platform. Unarchive the file and put the executable file
in some `$PATH` directory. Currently, the following targets are supported. If you want a binary for some other platform, feel free
to make an issue to request it.

- Linux (x86_64-gnu, x86_64-musl, aarch64-gnu)
- macOS (x86_64, aarch64)
- Windows (x86_64-msvc)

### Via [Homebrew][homebrew]

By adding hgrep repository as Homebrew tap, `hgrep` command can be installed and managed via Homebrew. [The formula][formula]
supports x86_64/aarch64 macOS and x86_64 Linux.

```sh
brew tap "rhysd/hgrep" "https://github.com/rhysd/hgrep"
brew install hgrep
```

Note: If you installed Homebrew to a non-default location (e.g. `~/homebrew`), you might see some errors. In the case, please try
to install `hgrep` via [cargo][] instead. See [#6][issue-6] for more details.

### Via [MacPorts][macports]

On macOS, you can install `hgrep` with the following commands through MacPorts:

```sh
sudo port selfupdate
sudo port install hgrep
```

### For NetBSD

To install pre-built binaries using the package manager, simply run:

```sh
pkgin install hgrep
```

Or, if you prefer to build from source,

```sh
cd /usr/pkgsrc/textproc/hgrep
make install
```

### Via [cargo][] package manager

```sh
cargo install hgrep
```

Since `cargo` builds `hgrep` command from sources, you can choose your favorite features and drop others by feature flags. For
example, if you always use `hgrep` with reading `grep` output from stdin and don't use `bat` printer, only enabling `syntect-printer`
dramatically reduces the number of dependencies, installation time, and binary size.

```sh
cargo install hgrep --no-default-features --features syntect-printer
```

### Feature flags

All features are optional and enabled by default. At least `bat-printer` or `syntect-printer` needs to be enabled.

| Feature           | Description                                                                                                                   |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ripgrep`         | Built-in grep implementation built on top of [ripgrep][] as a library. Performance is better than piping `rg` in some cases.  |
| `syntect-printer` | Our own printer implementation built with [syntect][] library. Performance and output layout are optimized for our use cases. |
| `bat-printer`     | Printer implementation built on top of [bat][]'s pretty printer, which is battle-tested and provides some unique features.    |

For the differences of `bat-printer` and `syntect-printer`, see ['`bat` printer v.s. `syntect` printer'][bat-vs-syntect] section.

## Usage

### Built-in ripgrep

Optionally hgrep provides built-in grep implementation thanks to [ripgrep][] as a library. It is a subset of `rg` command.

Built-in ripgrep is a recommended way to use hgrep because it is optimized for the use case.

When a pattern is given, `hgrep` command search files in given paths with it. When a directory is included in paths, hgrep
searches it recursively. When no path is given, hgrep searches the current directory.

```sh
hgrep [options...] pattern [paths...]
```

By default, hgrep shows at least 3 lines and at most 6 lines as context of a match. How many context lines is determined by some
heuristics around blank lines for space efficiency. Minimum context lines can be specified by `-c` and maximum context lines can
be specified by `-C`. If you don't want the heuristics, give the same value to the options like `-c 6 -C 6`.

```sh
# At least 10 context lines and at most 20 context lines
hgrep pattern  -c 10 -C 20 paths...
```

When you want a pager, please pipe the output to external commands like `less`. `$COLUMNS` needs to be passed because terminal
width is fixed to 80 characters when stdout is not connected to TTY. If you frequently use a pager,
['Set default command options'](#set-default-command-options) section would describe a better way.

```sh
hgrep --term-width "$COLUMNS" [options...] pattern paths... | less -R
```

It's faster when there are so many matches because everything is done in the same process. In combination with `syntect-printer`
feature, matched regions can be highlighted in a searched text color. The built-in grep feature is enabled by default and can be
omitted by feature flags.

Though almost all useful options are implemented, the built-in grep implementation is a subset of ripgrep. If you need full
functionalities, use `rg` command and eat its output by hgrep via stdin. Currently there are the following restrictions.

- Preprocessor is not supported (e.g. search zip files)
- Pattern file (`-f` or `--file` of `rg`) is not supported
- Sorting results (`--sort` and `--sortr`) is not supported because it significantly slows down printing the search output
- Memory map is not used until `--mmap` flag is specified
- Adding and removing file types are not supported. Only default file types are supported (see `--type-list`)
- `.ripgreprc` config file is not supported

### Eat `grep -nH` output

When no pattern and paths are given in command line arguments, hgrep can take grep results via stdin. Since hgrep expects file
paths and line numbers in each line of the output, `-nH` is necessary at `grep` command.

```sh
grep -nH pattern -R paths... | hgrep [options...]
```

`grep` alternative tools like [ripgrep][], [ag][], [pt][], ... are also available because they can output results compatible with
`grep -nH`.

```sh
rg -nH pattern paths... | hgrep [options...]
```

### `bat` printer v.s. `syntect` printer

hgrep provides two printers to print match results; `bat` printer and `syntect` printer. `bat` printer is a printer
implementation built on top of [bat][]'s pretty printer. And `syntect` printer is our own printer implementation built with
[syntect][] library. `--printer` (or `-p`) flag can specify the printer to print results.

At first, there was `bat` printer only. And then `syntect` printer was implemented for better performance and optimized layout.

#### Pros of each printer

- `syntect` printer
  - Performance is much better. 2x to 4x faster (more match results get better performance).
  - Output layout is optimized for our use cases. Matched regions are highlighted in a searched text color. A line number at a
    match is highlighted in a different color.
  - Painting background color (`--background`) is supported. This is useful when your favorite theme does not fit to your
    terminal's background color.
  - Themes are optimized for showing matched results. And some new themes like [ayu][] or [predawn][] are available. See the
    output of `--list-themes` to know the list of all themes.
  - Compatibility for old terminals is better. It automatically changes the default theme to 'ansi' for 16-colors terminals. And
    it provides `--ascii-lines` flag to draw border lines with ascii characters instead of Unicode characters like '├', '┬', and
    so on.
- `bat` printer
  - Implementation is battle-tested. It is already used by many users on many platforms and terminals.
  - The behavior is compatible with `bat` command. Its output layout is the same as `bat` command respecting `BAT_THEME` and
    `BAT_STYLE` environment variables. It can load bat's custom assets cache.

`syntect` is the default printer.

#### Themes only available with `syntect` printer

(and more...)

#### Why performance of `syntect` printer is better?

Syntax highlighting is very CPU-heavy task. Many regular expression matchings happen at each line. For accurate syntax
highlighting, a highlighter needs to parse the syntax from the beginning of file. It means that printing a match at the last
line of a file is a much heavier task than printing a match at the first line of the file.

Since `syntect` printer is designed for calculating syntax highlights per file in parallel, its performance is much better. It's
2x~4x faster than `bat` printer in some experiments. More match results get better performance.

In contrast, bat is not designed for multi-threads. It's not possible to share `bat::PrettyPrinter` instance across threads. It
means that printing match results including syntax highlighting must be done in a single thread.

|----------------------------|------------------------|
| ![](https://github.com/rhysd/ss/raw/master/hgrep/comparison_syntect.png) | ![](https://github.com/rhysd/ss/raw/master/hgrep/comparison_bat.png) |

### Change color theme and layout

The default color theme is `Monokai Extended` respecting `bat` command's default. Other theme can be specified via `--theme`
option. To know names of themes, try `--list-themes` flag.

```sh
hgrep --theme Nord ...
```

The default layout is 'grid'. To reduce borderlines to use space more efficiently, `--no-grid` option is available.

```sh
hgrep --no-grid ...
```

When you use `bat` printer, hgrep respects `BAT_THEME` and `BAT_STYLE` environment variable. Theme set to `BAT_THEME`
is used by default. And the grid layout is used when `plain` or `header` or `numbers` is set to `BAT_STYLE`. `syntect`
printer does not look at these variables. To set default theme, please use a command alias in your shell (See
['Set default command options'](#set-default-command-options) for details).

```sh
export BAT_THEME=OneHalfDark
export BAT_STYLE=numbers
hgrep -p bat ...
```

When `syntect` printer is used, painting background colors is supported with `--background` flag.

```sh
hgrep --background ...
```

### Set default command options

Wrapping `hgrep` command with shell's `alias` command works fine for setting default command options.

For example, if you're using Bash and want to search hidden files with `bat` printer, you can put the following line in your
`.bash_profile`.

```sh
# Search hidden files with 'bat' printer by default
alias hgrep='hgrep --hidden --printer bat'
```

If you like a pager, try the following wrapper function. `--term-width` propagates the correct width of the terminal window.
Passing terminal width via the option is necessary because `hgrep`'s stdout is not connected to a terminal when it is piped to
a pager process.

```sh
# Always use ayu-dark theme enabling background colors with less as pager. $COLUMNS corrects terminal window width
function hgrep() {
    command hgrep --theme ayu-dark --background --term-width "$COLUMNS" "$@" | less -R
}
```

Author's Zsh configuration for `hgrep` is [here][rhysd-config].

### Command options

- Common options
  - `--min-context NUM` (`-c`): Minimum lines of leading and trailing context surrounding each match. Default value is 3
  - `--max-context NUM` (`-C`): Maximum lines of leading and trailing context surrounding each match. Default value is 6
  - `--no-grid` (`-G`): Remove borderlines for more compact output. `--grid` flag is an opposite of this flag
  - `--tab NUM`: Number of spaces for tab character. Set 0 to pass tabs through. Default value is 4
  - `--theme THEME`: Theme for syntax highlighting. Default value is the same as `bat` command
  - `--list-themes`: List all available theme names and their samples for --theme option
  - `--printer`: Printer to print the match results. 'bat' or 'syntect' is available. Default value is 'bat'
  - `--term-width NUM`: Width (number of characters) of terminal window
  - `--wrap MODE`: Text-wrapping mode. 'char' enables character-wise text-wrapping. 'never' disables text-wrapping. Default value is 'char'
  - `--first-only` (`-f`): Show only the first code snippet per file
- Only for `ripgrep` feature
  - `--no-ignore`: Don't respect ignore files (.gitignore, .ignore, etc.)
  - `--ignore-case` (`-i`): When this flag is provided, the given pattern will be searched case insensitively
  - `--smart-case` (`-S`): Search case insensitively if the pattern is all lowercase. Search case sensitively otherwise
  - `--hidden` (`-.`): Search hidden files and directories. By default, hidden files and directories are skipped
  - `--glob GLOB...` (`-g`): Include or exclude files and directories for searching that match the given glob
  - `--glob-case-insensitive`: Process glob patterns given with the -g/--glob flag case insensitively
  - `--fixed-strings` (`-F`): Treat the pattern as a literal string instead of a regular expression
  - `--word-regexp` (`-w`): Only show matches surrounded by word boundaries
  - `--follow` (`-L`): When this flag is enabled, hgrep will follow symbolic links while traversing directories
  - `--multiline` (`-U`): Enable matching across multiple lines
  - `--multiline-dotall`: Enable "dot all" in your regex pattern, which causes '.' to match newlines when multiline searching is enabled
  - `--crlf`: When enabled, hgrep will treat CRLF (`\r\n`) as a line terminator instead of just `\n`. This flag is useful on Windows
  - `--mmap`: Search using memory maps when possible. mmap is disabled by default unlike hgrep

  - `--max-depth NUM`: Limit the depth of directory traversal to NUM levels beyond the paths given
  - `--max-filesize NUM+SUFFIX?`: Ignore files larger than NUM in size. This does not apply to directories.The input format accepts suffixes of K, M or G
  - `--line-regexp` (`-x`): Only show matches surrounded by line boundaries. This is equivalent to putting `^...$` around the search pattern
  - `--invert-match` (`-v`): Invert matching. Show lines that do not match the given pattern
  - `--pcre2` (`-P`): When this flag is present, hgrep will use the PCRE2 regex engine instead of its default regex engine
  - `--type TYPE` (`-t`): Only search files matching TYPE. This option is repeatable
  - `--type-not TYPE` (`-T`): Do not search files matching TYPE. Inverse of --type. This option is repeatable
  - `--type-list`: Show all supported file types and their corresponding globs
  - `--one-file-system`: When enabled, the search will not cross file system boundaries relative to where it started from
  - `--no-unicode`: Disable unicode-aware regular expression matching
  - `--regex-size-limit NUM+SUFFIX?`: The upper size limit of the compiled regex. The default limit is 10M. For the size suffixes, see --max-filesize
  - `--dfa-size-limit NUM+SUFFIX?`: The upper size limit of the regex DFA. The default limit is 10M. For the size suffixes, see --max-filesize
- Only for `syntect-printer` feature
  - `--background`: Paint background colors. This is useful when your favorite theme does not fit to your terminal's background color
  - `--ascii-lines`: Use ASCII characters for drawing border lines instead of Unicode characters
- Only for `bat-printer` feature
  - `--custom-assets`: Load bat's custom assets from cache. Note that this flag may not work with some version of `bat` command

See `--help` for the full list of available options in your environment.

### Generate completion scripts

Shell completion script for `hgrep` command is available. `--generate-completion-script` option generates completion script and
prints it to stdout. [Bash][bash], [Zsh][zsh], [Fish][fish], [PowerShell][pwsh], [Elvish][elvish] are supported. See `--help` for
the argument of the option.

This is an example of setup the completion script on Zsh.

```sh
# Let's say we set comps=~/.zsh/site-functions
hgrep --generate-completion-script zsh > ~/.zsh/site-functions/_hgrep
chmod +x ~/.zsh/site-functions/_hgrep
```

### Generate man page

Manual page for `hgrep` command is available. `--generate-man-page` flag generates the man page and prints it to stdout.

This is an example to generate man page in `/usr/local/share`.

```sh
hgrep --generate-man-page > /usr/local/share/man/man1/hgrep.1

# See manual page
man hgrep
```

### Exit status

`hgrep` command returns exit statuses as follows.

| Status | Description                         |
|--------|-------------------------------------|
|   0    | One or more matches were found      |
|   1    | No match was found                  |
|   2    | Some error happened (e.g. IO error) |

## Versioning

At this point the major version is fixed to 0. The minor version is bumped when some breaking changes are added. The patch
version is bumped when some new compatible changes are added and/or some bug fixes are added.

## Alternatives

Some other alternatives instead of using hgrep.

### Small ShellScript to combine `ripgrep` and `bat`

ripgrep and bat are well-designed tools so they can be used as building parts of a small script.

```sh
rg -nH ... | while IFS= read -r line; do
  # Parse $line and calculate the range of snippet and highlighted lines
  file=...
  lines=...
  range=...

  # Show matched snippet
  bat -H ${lines} -r ${range} ${file}
done
```

It works fine but hgrep is more optimized for this usage.

- When the matches are near enough, the lines are printed in one snippet.
- Performance is much better than running `bat` process per matched line.
- hgrep computes efficient context lines based on some heuristics.
- hgrep is available where ShellScript is unavailable (e.g. PowerShell).

### Fuzzy finder like `fzf` with `bat` preview window

Fuzzy finder like [fzf][] provides a preview window functionality and `bat` can print the match in the preview window.

```sh
grep -nH ... | \
    fzf --preview='bat --pager never --color always -H {2} -r {2}: -p {1}' --delimiter=:
```

This usage is great when you need the incremental search, but you need to check each preview of matches one by one.

hgrep focuses on surveying all the matches.
